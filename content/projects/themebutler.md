ThemeButler is an experiment in ad-supported WordPress themes. The idea is simple. I create premium quality themes and other design resources and give them away for free. I don’t provide support, but there is a community forum and the option of paid support packages with one of our support partners.

Will it work? Only time will tell. Being that I’m flying solo again, I have a bit more wriggle room to test out new ideas. Worse case scenario is the WordPress community get a couple more quality free themes to choose from.

Wireframes, mobile layouts and final comps all designed in Sketch.app.
Theme and additional functional built using the awesome Beans framework.
No 3rd party plugins were used in making of the site.
