The EdenHub Marketplace is an extension of the EdenHub project, which is an NGO myself and a friend started when we realised the fragility of our food systems. The project aims to support local producers, by helping them farm more productively, while giving them an avenue to sell their produce. 

We're launching the marketplace in the next month or so and are establishing a delivery network from Swellendam to Natures Valley.
