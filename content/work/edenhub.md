A project that is close to my heart, which I have worked on for just over a year. Our strategy is to establish a cooperative of small-scale producers, each focussing on what is best suited to their unique land, wildlife and other factors. 

In addition to this, we're creating multiple avenues for local producers to sell their goods, which include an online marketplace, multiple retail outlets and representation via shared market stalls across the Garden Route.

To keep the delivery cost as low as possible, we're recruiting a network of collection points (12 so far and counting), where producers can drop off their orders.
