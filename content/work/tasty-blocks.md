I've been considering re-entering the theme/plugin market and one of the ideas I've been playing with is TastyBlocks, which would be the home of my Gutenberg blocks, all tailored around the food-blogging market. 

I managed to get quite a bit of experience working with Gutenberg during my stint at WineFolly, so I'm confident I could create a collection of related blocks and themes. That said, this one will have to continue gathering dust until I'm in a position to pursue it properly.
